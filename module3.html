										<h3>Tasks and Assignments Done throughout this Module</h3>
										<p>Below is a breakdown of the activities done weekly during the 12-Unit Module. </p>
																			
										<p><ol type="disk"></ol>

											<li><b>Week 1: Unit 1 - An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</b></li>
											<p>We had a Lecture cast, book reading and a having a seminar session with the Lecturer that focused on the common definitions, concepts and process of not only Security and Risk Management, but also of terms like Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, risks, threats, vulnerabilities, Industry 4.0, digitization, etc).<br />
											I learnt on the different types of Standards and there compatibility to OpenFAIR framework (i.e. ISO 31000, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, NIST 800-30, COSO ERM, etc) and also looked on OpenFAIR and OCTAVE framework. <br />
											We also looked at the approaches to quantify and qualify risks, and also categorisation of the risk standards to different situations.</p>
											<p>We were assigned to groups by our lecturer so that we work on an Assessment Project. 3 of my peers and I were assigned to Group 1.   </p>
											<p>A Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 was held whereby we were to  "<em> read a case study by (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) and answer the 3 questions below: <ol type="circle">
												<li> What do the authors mean by the term 'Industry 4.0' - give two examples.</li>											
												<li>Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.</li> 
												<li>Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study."</li> 																	
											</em></ol> </p>
											<p>Below is My Initial Post on the Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 that I shared with my peers.</p>

											<p><li><b>Week 2: Unit 2 - Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process </b></li>
											<p>With the use of books and a seminar lesson with the Lecturer, we dived deeper into the effect of different types of assessment (Qualitative vs. Quantitative) and the importance of user participation in the risk management process. </p>
											<p>Via emailing, we held our first group discussion on how we will progress and the rules to be followed so as to successfully compete our project. We used Google Docs (which we shared editing rights amongst ourselves) to efficiently create the contract document together. </p>
											<p>My group members and I found an efficient solution for mode of communication (we saw it best to exchange WhatsApp phone numbers for creating a group for chat messages and also use personal email addresses for sending documents and zoom invitation links for video call meetings). </p>
											<p>The Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 was still on going, whereby I read the posts of my peers and responded to some of them. Below is a screenshot of a response I wrote on my peer's post.</p>

											<p><li><b>Week 3: Unit 3 - Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</b></li>
											<p>We had a Lecture cast and book reading that focused on the popular Threat Modelling Approaches/Frameworks: STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees and hybrid models such as the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA). </p>
											<P>We were also guided on how to select the right framework to use as per a case study and I learned that one could perform risk assessment on one case study using multiple approaches.</P>
											<p>We were assigned a case study (a Development Team Project) to do in Groups. The requirement was to create and design a <em>Risk Identification report (which was to be handed in on week 6) and an Executive Summary (which was to be handed in on week 11)</em>.</p>
											<p>My group members and I held a meeting to discuss on the creation of the Risk Identification Report. Below is a minute from the meetings we had. </p>

											<p><li><b>Week 4: Unit 4 - Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques </b></li>
												<p>With the use of books, practical examples, reading activities, and a seminar, we practiced threat modelling and management: using the threat modelling manifesto, the OWASP cookbook and the Mitre ATT&CK database. <br />
												Additionally, we had a seminar session with the lecturer and did some threat modelling exercises (creation of a threat model based on different case scenarios provided).</p>
												<p>Using <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual Paradigm UML tool</a> to design a couple of Use-case diagrams and Sequence diagrams, and doing personal researches (sources are referenced on the left panel), I was able to create a document as part of my contribution towards successful completion of the Risk Identification report. Below is the document that I presented in my group.</p>

											<p><li><b>Week 5: Unit 5 - An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise</b></li>
												<p>With the use of a Lecture cast and books, I got to gain knowledge on the roles of standards in risk assessments and risk designs, the commonly used standards, and also the implications of risk standards for various industries.</p>
												<p>We reviewed a couple of GDPR case studies and below is an exercise that I did on it. which was to be reviewed by the Lecturer on week 6's seminar. Below is my review on one of the case studies.</p>

												<p>My group members and I held a meeting to continue with the discussion on the Risk Identification Report. We discussed on what information is to be applied on the final draft, appendix, tables, charts, etc, so as to achieve the 1000-word count. </p>
												

												<li><b>Week 6: Unit 6 - The Practical Implications of Security and Risk Standards</b></li>
												<p>After a read and seminar session with the lecturer, I got to learn the standards that define security compliance for different industries and locations: Examples of some the standards are GDPR standard (UK/EU), ISO 27000(global), NIST (globally), etc. </p>
												<p>On the seminar session, we discussed some case studies and the standards that are more applicable to them. </p>
												<p>My group members and I held a meeting to continue with the discussion on the Risk Identification Report. We discussed on matters left so as to finish our final copy: like information to be included in the main body, tables, charts and in the appendix, information that needs to be added or deleted, plus adding of references, and text formatting, etc. Below is a screenshot of an e-mail we received from our group leader after the meeting we had. </p>

												<p><li><b>Week 7: Unit 7 - An Introduction to the Concepts of Quantitative Risk Modelling</b></li>
													<p>With the use of Lecturecast and book reading, we covered on the methods that can be used as part of quantitative risk modelling: probabilistic approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes theorem-based methods, as well as multi-criteria decision analysis techniques such as TOPSIS, AHP and ANP. </p> 
													<p>I also learnt the various scenarios and principles that are needed for the application of the quantitative approaches. Not forgetting their tools eg YASAI, monteCarlito, @risk, etc, and the probability distributions eg uniform, binomial, geometric, etc.</p>
													<p>Not forgetting, we were tasked with risk modelling activities on Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel and Bayes. </p>
													<p>A Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 was held whereby we were to  "<em> read Spring et al (2021) and answer the 2 questions below: <ol type="circle">
														<li> What characteristics of CVSS do the authors criticise? Do you agree with the critique? Justify your answer with academic references.</li>											
														<li>The authors also discuss a number of alternatives to CVSS. Select one of these alternatives and post an argument for why it should replace CVSS.</li> 
													</em></ol> </p>
													
													
												<p><li><b>Week 8: Unit 8 - Implementing Quantitative Risk Models </b></li>
