										<h3>Overview of Key Tasks and Projects Completed</h3>
										<p>Using Lecture casts, book reading and a having a seminar sessions with the Lecturer, this module provided an <b>in-depth understanding of Security and Risk Management </b>through various activities, assessments, and group projects.<br/>
										Below is an organized overview of the tasks and assignments I completed during the Module.</p>
										

										<p><ol type="disk"></ol>

											<li><b>Introduction to Security and Risk Management</b></li>
											<p>Focused on the common definitions, concepts and processes of not only <b>Security and Risk Management, but also of terms like Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, risks, threats, vulnerabilities, Industry 4.0, digitization, etc.</b></p>
											<p>Learnt on the different <b>types of Standards and there compatibility to OpenFAIR framework (i.e. ISO 31000, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, NIST 800-30, COSO ERM, etc) and also looked on OpenFAIR and OCTAVE framework.</b> </p>
											<p>Looked at the <b>approaches to quantify and qualify risks, and also categorisation of the risk standards to different situations.</b></p>
											<p>Our lecturer assigned us to group of 4 so that we work on an Assessment Project. </p>
											


											<li><b> Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process </b></li>
											<p>Dived deeper into the <b>effects of different types of assessment (Qualitative vs. Quantitative).</b> </p>
											<p>Learned the importance of <b>user participation</b> in the risk management process to ensure accurate assessment and mitigation strategies.</p>
											<p>Collaborated with members of my group (using WhatsApp for texts and calls, personal emails, zoom and teams video calls and Google Docs), to develop a <b>Risk Identification Report</b>, which required us to create a detailed risk assessment document.</p>
											
											
											<li><b>Threat Modelling and Management</b></li>
											<p>Focused on the popular <b>Threat Modelling Approaches/Frameworks: STRIDE, DREAD, Attack Trees and hybrid models such as the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA).</b> </p>
											<P>Guided on how to select the right framework(S) to use as per a case study and I learned that one could perform risk assessment on one case study using multiple approaches.</P>
											<p>We were assigned a <b>case study (a Development Team Project) to do in Groups. The requirement was to create and design a <em>Risk Identification report (which was to be handed in on week 6) and an Executive Summary (which was to be handed in on week 11)</b></em>.</p>
											<p>Designed <b>Use-case diagrams and Sequence diagrams Using <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual Paradigm UML tool</a> to represent system workflows and identify potential threats.</b></p>

											
											<li><b>Security and Risk Standards in the Industry and the Enterprise</b></li>
												<p>Studied different <b>security standards such as GDPR standard (UK/EU), ISO 27000 (global), NIST (globally), etc.  and their relevance to security compliance across different industries and locations.</b></p>											
												<p>Analyzed case studies to understand <b>the implications of these standards in various scenarios.</b></p>
												<p>Participated in a seminar discussing <b>the practical applications of Security and Risk Standards.</b></p>

												
												<li><b>Quantitative Risk Modelling</b></li>
													<p>Covered on the methods that can be used as part of quantitative risk modelling: <b>probabilistic approaches such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes Theorem-based methods, as well as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques such as TOPSIS, AHP and ANP.</b> </p> 
													<p>Learnt the various scenarios and principles that are needed for the <b>application of the quantitative approaches. </b>Not forgetting <b>their tools eg YASAI, monteCarlito, @risk, etc, and the probability distributions eg uniform, binomial, geometric, etc.</b></p>
													<p>Performed <b>risk modelling activities on Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel and Bayes.</b> </p>
													<p>Participated in a Collaborative Learning Discussion, <b>critiquing the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and discussing alternatives for risk assessment.</b></p>
													
												

												<li><b> Risk, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. </b> </li>
													<p>Gained knowledge on<b> creating and implementing Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) plans.</b>As well as <b>its contributing factors such as Business Impact Assessments (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).</b></p>
													<p>Learnt the different <b>solutions to meet specific recovery objectives.</b> The examples of the solutions included: <b>Hybrid cloud model, Cloud DRaaS like Amazon (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), Google (GCP), Alibaba, IBM, Rackspace and many others. </b></p>
													<p>	Contributed to the development of a <b> Disaster Recovery Plan and an Executive Summary outlining the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery solutions for a given case study.</b> </p> 	
													
												
												<li><b>Future Trends in Security and Risk Management </b></li>
													<p>Explored current and future trends in Security and Risk Management, and their advantages, disadvantages and impacts. </p>
													<p>These future trends included <b> Enterprise Risk Management (ERM), Machine Learning, DevSecOps, Artificial Intelligence, Science Security, etc.</b></p>
													<p>Participated in the Great Debate on the most influential trends in Security and Risk Management, whereby as a group we focused on Software Supply Chain Management as the trend for the future of Security and Risk Management (SRM).</p>


												<li><b>Conclusion </b></li>
													<p>This module provided a comprehensive overview of Security and Risk Management, combining theoretical frameworks with practical group projects. </br>
														The skills and knowledge gained will contribute significantly to my professional development, preparing me for real-world cybersecurity challenges.</p>
													<p>Submitted a<b> Reflective Essay </b>analyzing key takeaways from this module, challenges faced, and how the acquired skills apply to real-world secure software development.</p>

													<p>- Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.</p> 
													<p>- Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study."</p>
