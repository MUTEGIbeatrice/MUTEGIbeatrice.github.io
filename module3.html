										<h3>Tasks and Assignments Done throughout this Module</h3>
										<p>Below is a breakdown of the activities done weekly during the 12-Unit Module. </p>
																			
										<p><ol type="disk"></ol>

											<li><b>Week 1: Unit 1 - An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</b></li>
											<p>We had a Lecture cast, book reading and a lesson with the Lecturer that focused on the common definitions, concepts and process of Security and Risk Management.<br />
											Industry 4.0, digitization, OpenFAIR framework, OCTAVE, were also some of the topics covered. <br />
											We also looked at the approaches to quantify and qualify risks, and also categorisation of the risk standards to different situations.</p>
											<p>We were also assigned to groups by our lecturer so that we work on an Assessment Project. 3 of my peers and I were assigned to Group 1.   </p>
											<p>A Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 was held whereby we were to  "<em> read a case study by (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019) and answer the 3 questions below: <ol type="circle">
												<li> What do the authors mean by the term 'Industry 4.0' - give two examples.</li>											
												<li>Give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors categories.</li> 
												<li>Find another journal article that either supports or contradicts the points made in the cited study."</li> 																	
											</em></ol> </p>
											<p>Below is My Initial Post on the Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 that I shared with my peers.</p>

											<p><li><b>Week 2: Unit 2 - Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process </b></li>
											<p>With the use of books and a seminar lesson with the Lecturer, we dived deeper into the effect of different types of assessment (Qualitative vs. Quantitative) and the importance of user participation in the risk management process. </p>
											<p>We held our first group meeting to discuss how we will progress and the rules to be followed so as to successfully compete our project. We used Zoom application for meetings and Google Docs (which we shared editing rights amongst ourselves) to efficiently create the contract document. </p>
											<p>My group members and I held another meeting to discuss on the creation of the Risk Identification Report. Below is a minute from the meetings we had. </p>

												Additionally, we had a seminar session with the lecturer and did threat modelling exercises.</p>
												<p>Using <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual Paradigm UML tool</a> to design a couple of Use-case diagrams and Sequence diagrams, and doing researches (sources are referenced on the left panel), I was able to create a document as part of my contribution towards successful completion of the Risk Identification report. Below is the document that I presented in my group.</p>
