	2. HYPOTHESIS INVESTIGATION

2.1	Description

The team’s hypothesis question focused on achieving the basic cybersecurity requirement of authentication and authorisation within a microservice. can authentication and authorisation be handled within the code or should it be carried out and achieved as a different microservice on a separate container? (de Almeida, M.G. and Canedo, E.D., 2022.) discussed heavily that microservice should focus on dividing the application into small services, each running separately and connected through an (API) application programming interface gateway only when required. our hypothesis attempted to confirm if the authentication and authorisation processes can be added into the code without impacting the efficiency of the code. as MQTT connects the publisher and subscribers via a trusted broker in practice. which is often the case since IoT device owners often also are provided control over the broker and still require to validate the ownership via a username and password in order to login to the platform or pbe rovided with different commands. the hypothesis question attempts to find a direct answer to service discovery limitations as microservice architecture make service discovery hard especially when inter-service communication is required (Yarygina, T. and Bagge, A.H., 2018).

2.2	The Model

The current model proposed attempt to simplify the microservices function and code management, by integrating the authentication and authorisation function within the MQTT application running within docker as a container. This would remove the requirement of having a complex infrastructure such as integrating the docker simulation code with a (RADIUS) remote authentication dial in server or an Accesses control list. This model is meant to overcome the complexity of adding different containers as computing resources tend to be  limited and due to several hardware constraints the team wanted to simplify the approach and utilise of containers with a secure code depyloment and simplified access through the use of a basic username and password that is secure, functional and practical. 

2.3  Experiments and Analysis
Manually testing the application 
we attempted to login to the application without going into the signup process and it failed which is the desired result. this proved that the code was an efficient approach to achieve the result of authentication and authorisation processes. (Al-Naji, F.H. and Zagrouba, R., 2020) focused on the importance of authentication and authorisation within IoT devices as a continuous process.

2.4 Python Script Testing with pylint
Pylint is an analysis tool that searches for errors, bugs, and other issues within Python code (Dasgupta & Hooshangi, 2017). To ensure our team’s Python code was secure, Pylint was used to test the code and improve each script. The initial code tests started with a score of 2.24 and was improved to reach the maximum score of 9.6
 
Figure 2.5: Pylint score for motion sensor and light clients before improvements.
 
Figure 2.6: Pylint score for motion sensor and light clients after improvements.
The pylint score increased from 6.00 to 9.60. The variable “rc” was left as it was as this is commonly used in other scripts.

Figure 2.8: Light client simulator pylint after improvements.
 
Figure 2.9: Hub simulator pylint score before improvements.
 
Figure 2.10: Hub simulator pylint after before improvements.
These scores show a large improvement in each of the scripts, allowing for more efficient code using best practices. 
2.5 Docker Vulnerability test

The test can only be carried out after building the image, then go to the container tab and selecting view image, several vulnerabilities were identified by Docker as it built the images with the most stable release of the Debian OS.

Figure 2.12: The above image is for the Debian destroy utilised within docker

 
Figure 2.13: The above image is for vulnerabilities with python 3.11 and used libraries.

2.6 Bandit Testing 

Step 1: install bandit with the following command:
	Pip install bandit
Step 2: run the following command to test the python code 
	Bandit -r motionDevice_Copy.py

 
Figure 2.14: installing bandit

 
Figure 2.15: Running Bandit test on our python code

Final Bandit output:

Test results:
>> Issue: [B311:blacklist] Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.
   Severity: Low   Confidence: High
   CWE: CWE-330 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)
   Location: motionDevice_Copy.py:110:38


2.7	Conclusion
We have concluded that the hypothesis requires more time to test and confirm if authentication and authorization can be carried out within python efficiently without the assistance of additional microservices adding further complexity to the simulation. although the desired result was achieved, further evidence such as log’s and appropriate checks on the security of the authentication and authorisation, was not achieved as it broke the MQTT code and stopped the main objective was to simulate the IoT environment required for a smart home light system. 
Recommendations and improvements:
•	Physical network/VPN for ultimate security; to connect the IoT devices with a master control hub in a secure manner. 
•	(TLS) Transport layer security with certificate credentials from CA for all connections;
•	All inbound ports should be disabled at MQTT edge clients; and additionally restricted with a firewall access list implementation. 
•	Only two TCP/IP ports (8883 and 443) should be open at the MQTT server;
•	Use MQTT client username/password at MQTT servers; and ensure audit trails are stored separately for forensic use if required. 
•	ACLs should be used to limit MQTT client access to the topic levels they can either publish or subscribe to.
•	Enable the use of biometric authentication prior to access of the MQTT platform / Smarthome system to ease the login process of the user. 




3.	HOW TO / CODE INSTRUCTIONS/SOURCE CODE
Requirements and setup/ running the application guideline
Install docker desktop on windows available from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Install python for windows, available from: https://www.python.org/downloads/  current version in use is 3.11
Steps to run the microservices applications:
1.	Navigate to the folder SSA_DockerProject with CMD
a.	One terminal window should be dedicated to running the Hub Docker file
b.	One terminal window should be dedicated to running the Light Docker file
2.	Within the first command line window run the command to build the docker image 
1.	docker build -t g2-mqtt-hub .      # command is used to build the image
2.	docker run -i -t g2-mqtt-hub       # command is used to run the container

When deleting the images on docker first start with deleting the container, then delete the image when it's no longer required in that order. 

download paho.mqtt by running 
    pip install paho-mqtt

to run a pyscript use cmd terminal and run the name of the script eg. lightControl.py
then run the python file
