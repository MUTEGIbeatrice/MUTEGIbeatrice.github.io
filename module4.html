										<h3>Tasks and Assignments Done throughout this Module</h3>
										<p>Below is a breakdown of the activities done weekly during the 6-Unit Module. </p>
																			
										<p><ol type="disk"></ol>

											<li><b>Week 1: Unit 1 - Introduction to Secure Software Development </b></li>
											<p>After going through a Lecture cast, books and having a seminar session with the Lecturer, we got to explore the waterfall and agile approaches to software development, with a focus on the implications of developing secure software using each.</p>
											<p>We also become acquainted with the Unified Modelling Language and how it can be used to support software development and also gained a familiarity with the standards which are used by industry to develop secure software. </p> 
											<p>Additionally, we got to see the importance of developing a risk-aware culture within an organisation.</p>
											<p>A Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 was held, whereby each one of us was to choose an open-source UML tool (Visual Paradigm or Sequence Diagram or Umbrello). Then select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by  <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1026.html"> OWASP</a>.<br> We were then required to create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring.</p> 
											<p>Below is my Initial Post on the Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 that I shared with my peers whereby I chose to use <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual-paradigm </a>.</p>

											<p>We were also divided into groups so as to work on a project that was to be handed out in the course of this module.<br> 3 of my peers and I were placed in Group 2 and we exchanged information (like WhatsApp phone numbers, GitHub handles and Emails) thus enabling us to communicate with each other efficiently as we work on the project.  </p>


											<p><li><b>Week 2: Unit 2 - UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning </b></li>
											<p>Here we gained an awareness of the opportunities for integrating software security development practices at each stage of the agile SDLC and understood the range of ways in which software security can be problematic. </p> 
											<p>The Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 was still on going, whereby i read the posts of my peers and responded to some of them.</p>	
											<p> We were given an assessment project that required us to develop an application that provides a secure repository for a given case study. The project had 2 parts: Development Team Project: Design Document (Proposal Report) and Development Team Project: Coding Output. </p>
											<p>My group members and I started working on the first part of project <i>Development Team Project: Design Document</i>, focusing on <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/cybercrime/fighting-cybercrime-in-the-netherlands"> The Dutch Police Internet Forensics</a> case study. </p>
											<p>After using <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual Paradigm UML tool</a> to design a couple of UML diagrams and doing personal researches on the project (sources are referenced on the left pane), I was able to create and submit to my group the document below (as part of my contribution towards successful completion of the Development Team Project: Design Document).</p>

											<p><li><b>Week 3: Unit 3 - Introduction to Programming Languages </b></li>
											<p>We had a Lecture cast and book reading that reviewed the history and concepts of programming languages and investigated language concepts using Python.</p>
											<p>We covered on the best practices and methods to overcome common security issues. </p>	
											<p>We had a Codio activity on Buffer Overflow in both C and Python programming languages. Below is a screenshot of the Buffer Overflow in C.</p>

											<p>My group members and I were able to finalize the first part of the assessment, that is <i>Development Team Project: Design Document</i>, focusing on <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/cybercrime/fighting-cybercrime-in-the-netherlands"> The Dutch Police Internet Forensics</a> case study. Below is the essay that we handed out as a team. </p>

											<p><li><b>Week 4: Unit 4 - Introduction to Testing </b></li>
											<p>With the use of books, practical examples and reading activities, we explored the range of questions to ask when developing a test plan and the two industry software testing standards. </p>												
											<p>We learnt a range of testing techniques and the relevance of each in different testing scenarios.</p>
											<p>We also viewed the tools and frameworks which are available to support and automate the Python testing process.</p>
											<p>My group members and I started on the second part of the assignment that is <i>Development Team Project: Coding Output </i>, focusing on <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/cybercrime/fighting-cybercrime-in-the-netherlands"> The Dutch Police Internet Forensics</a> case study. </p>
											<p>We held a meeting and we agreed on doing the project on Django and as per Sprint 1 (that is outlined on our first handout on Development Team Project: Design Document). We agreed to do research on Web Application Development using Django:Python and on the next meeting we present and discuss our findings.</p>
											<p>After researching on the internet, I was able to successfully install Django and Python in my laptop and ran it, practiced and started to work on the project using Visual Studio Code.</p>
											

											<p><li><b>Week 5: Unit 5 - Future trends in Secure Software Development</b></li>
												<p>With the use of a Lecture cast, books and a lecture, we discussed the future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems. </p>
												<p>We also looked at Fog Computing, the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems, and explored the systems and solutions that can be investigated as possible research topics or fields.</p> 
												<p>During one of the meetings we held, we saw it fitting to divide up the workload amongst ourselves due to the 2 weeks we had left with to final submission. Therefore we agreed that I will develop the web applicaton (Sprint 1) using Django (since we were had only 2 weeks left to finish Sprint 1) while my groupmates will do the testing, documentation and demo. </p>
												<p>Below are screenshots of the work I did on the Django Web Application project (internetForensics) as from Github (our groupleader's repository).</p>
												<p>Below is admin.py screenshot. </p>

											<li><b>Week 6: Unit 6 - The Security of Programming Languages Debate</b></li>
											<p>We reviewed the security capabilities of a selection of programming languages, which include F#, Python, Rust, and Swift.
											<p>We also explored some of the advances needed to support secure programming.</p>
											<p>During the seminar, we were grouped in groups and had a debate on "<i>Programming Languages (about the above mentioned languages)</i>". </p>
											<p>After finalizing my part of the project (screenshots shown in week 5), I demonatrated and explained to my group members the project and its features so that they will be able to get the know-how of how the application runs. This enabled them to run tests and do documentation. </p>
											<p>Below are the final Tests document and documentation (a readme file) that was handed out to the lecturer.</p>	
											<p>Below is the Tests file that includes all the tests (and there screenshots) that were perfomed by one of my groupmates on the Django web application project . </p>
