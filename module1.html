											<p><li><b>Week 5: Unit 5 - Object-oriented Analysis, Design and Programming Techniques for Secure Systems</b></li>
												<p>With the use of a Lecture cast, books and Codio coding exercises, we learned the implementation of security solutions. We were introduced to Object-oriented approaches used to design solutions that secure software.</p>
												<p>Introduction to programming (Python) was also covered in Codio: Application of UML object-oriented modelling techniques, such as use case and sequence diagrams, to develop a design document required for project implementation.  </p> 
												<p>Using <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/"> Visual Paradigm UML tool</a>, I learned how to create Use-case diagrams, Abuse-case diagrams, Sequence diagrams, Class diagrams, etc. Below is an assignment I did about it.</p>
												<iframe src="images\Essex Assignments\Module1\UML Diagrams.pdf" width="100%" height="500px">
												</iframe>
												<a href="images\Essex Assignments\Module1\UML Diagrams.pdf" download>Download PDF </a></p>

												<li><b>Week 6: Unit 6 - Application of UML to Secure Software Design</b></li>
												<p>It focused on the practical application of UML diagrams in designing software that mitigates against threats and vulnerabilities: Using UML modelling techniques to identify software dataflow, storage and security issues: and applying the knowledge and skills to other security issues in software development. </p>
												<p>I continued learning and practising Python programming language using Codio. </p>
												<p>A Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 was held, whereby we discussed <i>"Identify and discuss two security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. Your discussion could consider either network or/and software security issues".</i><br /> Below is My Initial Post on the  Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 that I shared with my peers.</p>

												<p><li><b>Week 7: Unit 7 - Database Design and Implementation </b></li>
													<p>With the use of Lecture cast and book reading, we covered on databases: Concepts and Principles of database design and Approaches to developing secure databases. </p> 
													<p>I continued learning and practising Python Programming using Codio exercises </p>
													<p>The Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 was still on going, whereby i read the posts of my peers and responded to some of them.</p>
													
												<p><li><b>Week 8: Unit 8 - Introduction to Python Programming and MySQL </b></li>
													<p>With the use of book reading and lecturer's seminar, we covered on the practical skills of deploying security technologies that develop security solutions.</p> 
													<p>I started learning and practising MySQL database management software while I continued learning and practising Python Programming using Codio exercises. </p>
													<p>After reading my Peers views and responding to some them, I did a Summary Post that I shared in Collaborative Discussion 2.</p>
